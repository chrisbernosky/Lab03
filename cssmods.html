                The Kansas Jayhawks have won 12 Big 12 regular season titles in a row, which is perhaps the most impressive statistic going in college basketball.

                In a sport full of roster turnover, Bill Self has been a constant. And his Jayhawks have constantly dominated the Big 12 over the past decade and change. Kansas doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon, but you'd have to think that one of these years a conference foe will rise up and dethrone the Jayhawks.
